# Crypto Wallet App

This is a Next.js-based crypto wallet application.

## Development Notes

### Test PIN

**IMPORTANT:** During development, the PIN validation logic in `context/AuthContext.tsx` (`validatePin` function) has been temporarily modified to accept **'1234'** as a valid PIN for testing purposes (e.g., for the Change PIN flow).

**This modification MUST be removed before deploying the application to production.**
